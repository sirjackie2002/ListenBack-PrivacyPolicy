ListenBack ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how our mobile application, ListenBack (the "App"), interacts with your data. Please read this policy carefully to understand how we use and protect the information processed by the App.

1. Offline Functionality
ListenBack is designed to function entirely offline. The App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or usage data externally. All features of the App operate directly on your device without requiring an internet connection or any server-based interaction.

2. Information We Process
While we do not collect or store personal information, certain features of the App require access to your device’s resources:

a. Location Data
Purpose: Location data may be accessed to enable specific features, such as location-based alarms or enhanced recording functionalities.
Data Use: This data is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted, stored, or shared with us or any third party.
User Control: You have full control over granting or revoking location permissions at any time through your device’s settings.
Scope: The App uses location data solely for its intended functionality and does not retain this information once the feature is complete.
b. Audio Recording
Purpose: The App accesses your microphone to enable audio recording features.
Data Use: Recorded audio files are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to or collect these recordings.
User Control: You can manage or delete recordings directly from your device.
c. Notifications and Alarms
Purpose: The App may send notifications for alarms or timers you set within the App.
Data Use: Notifications are generated locally and do not involve the transmission of data outside your device.
3. Your Rights and Choices
Permissions Management: The App requires specific permissions to function correctly, such as access to your microphone and location. You can manage these permissions through your device’s settings.
Privacy by Design: The App is intentionally designed to avoid any collection of user data, ensuring your activity remains private and secure.
4. Third-Party Services
ListenBack does not use any third-party services, APIs, or integrations that would transmit or share your data.

5. Data Security
We do not collect, store, or transmit any data. As such, the security of your data is fully reliant on your device's security measures. We recommend using robust device security practices, such as PIN codes or biometric locks, to protect your data.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App’s functionality or legal requirements. You will be notified of any changes through the App or by other means if necessary. Continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the revised policy.
